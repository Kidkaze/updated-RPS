# updated-RPS

This is a re-do over of the rock-paper-scissors project created by The Odin Project. I learnt a lot about refactoring code but learnt more about functions and how variables work
within functions and outside of functions. 

This project really challenged me to understand the basics of how to tie together all the JS I have learnt thus far and I am proud of what I have been able to cobble together in a
lot less time than the first time I tried to do this project. Hopefully the things I have learned will stick with me on future projects.
